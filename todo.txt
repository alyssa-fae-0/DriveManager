Make a file access heatmap
	probably track  folder/node hits for N-levels deep
		3 levels would be everything in C:/, C:/*, and C:/*/*
Create [something] that monitors file reads 
	Injecting something into processes on the computer?
		I don't like that idea. It seems really hacky
	I guess I'll just work on manual mode for now
